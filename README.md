# JS-Algorithm/Problems

A daily practice of solving JavaScript coding problems.
These coding problems are from LeetCode and Codewars.

## Process
The process of tackling these problems is to comment out every step required to achieve the result first then write out the lines of code that performs each comment.

## When Stuck
There are times when I truly have no idea how to tackle a problem because I'm not familiar with the functions of arrays and lists. When times like these occur, I seek help on the internet. I will observe all the clever solutions and look for ones that really match my original thought process and see how they approach the section where I was stuck on. I then use that approach and fix my own solution. 

Key Point: NEVER copy and paste.
